Frontend Implementation
The frontend of this application uses Leaflet to display the vehicle's real-time location and its route on a map. Below is a brief overview of the implementation:

Files
index.html: The main HTML file that sets up the map and handles the vehicle tracking.
Key Components
HTML Structure

The HTML file includes:

A div element with the ID map to display the Leaflet map.
Linking to the Leaflet CSS for styling.
Inline CSS to set the map's height and width.
Leaflet Map Initialization

The map is initialized with Leaflet using the following code:

javascript code
const map = L.map('map').setView([37.7749, -122.4194], 13);
This initializes the map and sets the initial view to San Francisco with a zoom level of 13.

Tile Layer:OpenStreetMap tile layer is used to display map tiles:

javascript code
L.tileLayer('https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {
    maxZoom: 19,
}).addTo(map);

Vehicle Marker and Route Line : A vehicle marker is created to indicate the vehicle's position:

javascript code
let vehicleMarker = L.marker([37.7749, -122.4194]).addTo(map);
A polyline is used to draw the vehicle's route on the map:

javascript code
let routeLine = L.polyline([], { color: 'blue' }).addTo(map);
Fetching and Updating Vehicle Data

The updateVehiclePosition function fetches the vehicleâ€™s current position and route from the backend API and updates the map accordingly:

javascript code
const updateVehiclePosition = async () => {
    const response = await fetch('https://vehicle-tracking-backend.onrender.com/vehicle-data');
    const data = await response.json();

    const { position, route } = data;
    vehicleMarker.setLatLng([position.lat, position.lng]);
    routeLine.setLatLngs(route);
    map.setView([position.lat, position.lng]);
};
The setInterval function ensures that the updateVehiclePosition function is called every 3 seconds to update the vehicle's location and route:

javascript code
setInterval(updateVehiclePosition, 3000);


Follow the instructions in the Backend Setup section to start the backend server.

Open index.html

Open the index.html file in your browser to view the map and vehicle tracking.

Additional Information
Map Initialization: The map is initially centered on San Francisco but will move to the vehicle's current position as updates are received.

API Endpoint: Ensure that the backend server is running and accessible at the specified URL for the frontend to fetch vehicle data successfully.

Data Format: The backend API should return the data in the following format:

json code
{
  "position": {
    "lat": 37.7749,
    "lng": -122.4194
  },
  "route": [
    [37.7749, -122.4194],
    [37.7750, -122.4189],
    ...
  ]
}

Backend Implementation
The backend of this application is built using Node.js and Express. It provides an API endpoint to supply the vehicle's current location and route data to the frontend.

Files
server.js: The main server file that handles API requests and simulates vehicle movement.
Key Components
Dependencies

The server uses the following dependencies:

express: Web framework for Node.js.
cors: Middleware to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
Install these dependencies using npm:

npm install express cors
Server Setup

The server is created using Express and CORS middleware:

javascript code
const express = require('express');
const cors = require('cors');

const app = express();
app.use(cors());

Initial Vehicle Position and Route
The server initializes with a starting vehicle position in San Francisco and an empty route array:

javascript code
let vehiclePosition = { lat: 37.7749, lng: -122.4194 };
let route = [{ lat: 37.7749, lng: -122.4194 }];
Vehicle Movement Simulation

The updateVehiclePosition function simulates vehicle movement by randomly adjusting the latitude and longitude. This function is called every 3 seconds using setInterval:

javascript code
const updateVehiclePosition = () => {
    const deltaLat = (Math.random() - 0.5) / 100;
    const deltaLng = (Math.random() - 0.5) / 100;
    vehiclePosition.lat += deltaLat;
    vehiclePosition.lng += deltaLng;
    route.push({ ...vehiclePosition });
};

setInterval(updateVehiclePosition, 3000);
API Endpoint

The /vehicle-data endpoint returns the current vehicle position and route as a JSON response:

javascript code
app.get('/vehicle-data', (req, res) => {
    res.json({
        position: vehiclePosition,
        route: route,
    });
});
Server Listening

The server listens on port 3000:

javascript code
app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});
Running the Backend
Start the Server

Navigate to the directory containing server.js and start the server using Node.js:

node server.js
The server will run on http://localhost:3000.

Accessing the API

The API endpoint to get the vehicle data is available at:

http://localhost:3000/vehicle-data
This endpoint will return a JSON object with the current vehicle position and the route:

json code
{
  "position": {
    "lat": 37.7749,
    "lng": -122.4194
  },
  "route": [
    { "lat": 37.7749, "lng": -122.4194 },
    { "lat": 37.7750, "lng": -122.4193 },
    ...
  ]
}
Summary
This backend implementation simulates a vehicle's movement and provides the data to the frontend. Make sure the backend server is running before accessing the frontend application to ensure the data is correctly fetched and displayed.


This setup provides a real-time view of vehicle movement using Leaflet and data fetched from a backend API. Adjust the URL in the fetch call according to your backend deployment.
